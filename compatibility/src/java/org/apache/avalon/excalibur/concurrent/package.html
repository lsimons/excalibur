<p>Concurrency control utilities. </p>
<p><strong>This is deprecated in favor of Doug Lea's concurrency utils.</strong></p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This package provides utility classes commonly needed in
    concurrent java programming. They include important thread
    handling classes like Lock (a Mutex implementation),
    DjikstraSemaphore, ThreadBarrier, and ConditionalEvent. Read
    the javadocs for more information, and check out the
    <a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/avalon/excalibur/v4.1"
    >excalibur 4.1 release</a> for sample usage.

<h3>Move to Doug Lea's concurrency package!</h3>
    <p>
    <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/EDU/oswego/cs/dl/util/concurrent/intro.html"
    >Doug Lea's util.concurrent</a> package is the de-facto standard for
    concurrency management, and it provides all the functionality of
    Excalibur Concurrent. It is intended to be the replacement of the
    Collections code in Excalibur.</p>
