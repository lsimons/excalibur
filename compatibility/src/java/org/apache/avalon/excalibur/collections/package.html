<p>Collection utilities including binaryHeap, fixed,
 variable and circular buffers, and priority queues. </p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">These classes have all been deprecated in favor of
the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/">Jakarta Commons</a>
version of the collection classes.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    The introduction of the Collections API  by Sun in JDK 1.2 has been
    a boon to quick and effective Java programming. Ready access to powerful
    data structures has accelerated development by reducing the need for
    custom container classes around each core object. Most Java2 APIs are
    significantly easier to use because of the Collections API.

    However, there are certain holes left unfilled by Sun's implementations,
    and the Jakarta-Commons Collections Component strives to fulfill them.
    Among the features of this package are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Special-purpose implementations of Lists and Maps for fast access</li>
        <li>Adapter classes from Java1-style containers (arrays, enumerations)
        to Java2-style collections</li>
        <li>Methods to test or create typical set-theory properties of
        collections such as union, intersection, and closure</li>
    </ul>
