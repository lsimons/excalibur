Avalon is minimizing the number of projects and utilities it maintains
because we need to focus on our charter.  However, we do have users
who have used some of the projects that were previously released.  We
can't just ignore their needs.  The compatibility project is the
graveyard for projects we are no longer supporting.  It exists simply
to let our users (and in some cases, our users' users) continue to
use their legacy components until they migrate to better supported
libraries.

Most of the packages in this project have replacement libraries, but
it is inevitable that some in here may not have a replacement yet--
but the package falls outside our charter.  If you would like to
volunteer to maintain those packages in your own library, please
contact the Avalon Developer's List and let them know of your
availability. Packages with a definite and released replacement will
be completely deprecated and point to the new classes in the new
library.
