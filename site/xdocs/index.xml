                    The Excalibur Project contains a set of utilitiy projects 
                    used in the development of container facilities and as 
                    underlying system for cause-grain components such as the 
                    Cornerstone suite.

                                the package handle it for you, or you can use a J2EE server's
                                DataSource management.  It provides the same kind of access
                                regardless of which method you choose--since they are obtained
                                through Avalon's Component Manager infrastructure.

                                event based programming.  Event is heavily influenced by Matt
                                Welsh's work with the
                                <fork href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~mdw/proj/seda/">SEDA architecture</fork>.
                                We forked the portion of his SandStorm server that had to do with
                                event processing.  From there we cleaned up the API and made it as
                                generic as we could.

                                an interface for specifying the resource.  Support for
                                XML resource bundles are still under development.

                                Excalibur Instrument is an instrumentation utility that allows you
                                to attach a separate JVM to your running application to determine its
                                health.  Instrumentation is the process of exposing the internal state
                                in a way that is easy for an administrator or help desk personell to
                                digest.  Excalibur Instrumentation is such a package that you can use
                                for your Avalon based projects.

                                Excalibur-Logger integrates neatly into the Avalon ECM
                                and Fortress. The main goal is to
                                be able to define the log categories on a component basis by
                                specifying a 'logger' attribute which denotes the log category
                                to use for a particular component (given the
                                component is
                                <code>LogEnabled</code> or
                                <code>Loggable</code>).

                                Avalon Excalibur's resource management code allows you to
                                be notified when a resource has changed.  There are two
                                methods of resource management: active and passive.  Passive
                                resource management acts as a holder for resources, and after
                                the resource has been modified through it's normal API,
                                notification goes to all listeners.  Active resource management
                                does the same, but it also polls the resources periodically
                                to see if the resource was modified through an external method.
                                Active resource management is perfect for monitoring files
                                because they can be modified by external programs, and your
                                program will be notified when the change occurs instead of
                                constantly polling it.

                                There are many implementations that are ThreadSafe, and
                                one that is not.  You have the option of not limiting
                                used resources at all, or limiting the used resources
                                based on specific rules.

                                A very common problem is resolving a source, which means
                                finding a source using a URI.
                            </p>

                                The source resolver of Avalon Excalibur is a component
                                helping you in this task. It resolves sources from a given
                                URI. The URI can use all available protocols of the JRE.
                                In addition own protocols can be plugged-in. So using
                                the standard protocols like HTTP, FTP or file can be handled
                                in the same way, like dealing with custom, self-build
                                protocols such as myxmldatabase://root/documents/test.xml.

                                You can choose between different implementations that store
                                the data e.g. in memory or on the file system etc.

                                Avalon is minimizing the number of projects and utilities it maintains
                                because we need to focus on our charter.  However, we do have users
                                who have used some of the projects that were previously released.  We
                                can't just ignore their needs.  The compatibility project is the
                                graveyard for projects we are no longer supporting.  It exists simply
                                to let our users (and in some cases, our users' users) continue to
                                use their legacy components until they migrate to better supported
                                libraries.

                                Due to a number of issues in ECM, not the least of which is a
                                simplistic and convoluted design, it has been deprecated in
                                favor of Fortress or Merlin.  Fortress has been designed with
                                ECM users in mind, so it provides a number of goodies to make
                                it easier to migrate forward.  This project will be maintained
                                for bug fixes only.
