      <p>
        Fortress contains a framework to help you create your own
        avalon containers.  It boasts asynchronous management of your
        component instances, high scalability, easier maintenance of
        your code, and easy embedding into various environments like
        servlet engines.  Fortress replaces the older 
	Excalibur Component Manager (ECM) container.

         <strong>The Fortress documentation has not yet been updated for the latest
	 release</strong>.  We are currently working on new documentation in the 
	 <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/avalon/AvalonFortress">wiki</a>.

	  The Avalon developers are working to provide better consistency
	  between our containers (ECM, Fortress, Phoenix, Merlin).  We hope to
	  offer a single platform that will build on our previous efforts.
	  Please subscribe to the users or developers mailing list to receive
	  the latest updates.  See the wiki for more information on
	  <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/avalon/WhichContainer">which container</a>
	  to consider and <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/avalon/ContainerStory">where the 
	  containers came from</a>.
