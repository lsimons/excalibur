          The Store Package provides a way to store named objects without 
          taking care about where and how they are stored.
          You can choose between different implementations that store
          the data e.g. in memory or on the file system etc.

        This project provides some general components for dealing with stores.
        It contains different store implementations, like the
        <a href="store-mru.html">MRU Store</a> and a montoring component,
        the <a href="store-janitor.html">Store Janitor</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        These components have been donated by the <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org">Apache Cocoon project</a>.
